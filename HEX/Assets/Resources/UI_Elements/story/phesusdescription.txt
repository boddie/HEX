Phesus is an industrial city in the Chalcis Empire responsible for much of the nation’s industry. It’s inhabited by mostly functional architecture. The former citizens of Phesus were not rich by any means, and mostly consisted of laborers at steel and brass mills. The river that runs through it has been the centerpiece of the town since its founding. However, despite all this, the amount of brass and metal and machines have given it a look that is appealing to the Steampunks, because the city looks like a place where they belong. The Clockwork University is a nontraditional guild of magic, where everyone who wishes to learn goes to learn anything they can from all of the other members.
