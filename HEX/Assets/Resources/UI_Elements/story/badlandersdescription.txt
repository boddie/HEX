The Badlanders of the Ivory Tower of Magic are those from the Royal Academy who wanted to focus on magical research. They never believed it was the wizards’ proper place to rule or even influence the course of politics. They wanted to focus on the study of magic for the sake of knowledge, not for the sake of power. When the Engineers and the Necromancers started fighting, the Badlanders left the Chalcis Empire for the Formorian Badlands, a barely inhabitable part of the world: with more dangerous predators than prey. The leader of the Badlanders is Masriel, a fairly young man who was one of the lead magical researchers at the Royal Academy. Having to fight for their survival on a daily basis has made the Badlanders unlikely warriors, since all they really wanted to do was study. Unfortunately, their desire for isolation was interrupted when the Steampunks decided they needed a new home. While the Badlanders drove them off, it drew the Badlanders into the conflict they were hoping to avoid. 
The Badlanders believe learning magic is its own reward.
