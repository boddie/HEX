The Engineers of the Royal Academy of Magic are the remnants of the original Royal Academy that housed all of the wizards of Xanthia. The Royal Academy is in Solaris, the capital of the Chalcis Empire, the largest political entity in Xanthia. Previously, they were known as the Loyalists, for their loyalty to the Chalcis royal family. They are led by Rylan: the Archmage of the original Royal Academy, the inventor of the Altar, and one of the oldest living wizards. This put the Engineers at odds with the Necromancers, who attempted to seize power using the dark arts. Previously human, they constructed new bodies for themselves in order to draw on more magical energy without destroying their weak mortal coil. They became known as the Engineers after they created the Steampunks to defeat the Necromancers. When the Steampunks started making their own choices, however, the Engineers decided they had created something more dangerous than they believed, and a war started. 
The Engineers basic ideology is to use their wisdom and power to help mankind, influencing the royal family when necessary.
