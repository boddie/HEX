Sarvik, the darklands, are as their name describes: dark. They exist outside of the Chalcis Empire because they are completely uninhabitable. The intense fog that permeates the air is barely breathable by humans, and kills any plant life except the most rugged shrubs. Somehow, there is a full ecosystem living on these inedible plants, all the way from poisonous herbivores to vicious man-eating carnivores. The Necropolis that the Necromancers have built is a dark and hazy place that can only be considered home by someone who is hardly alive: like the Necromancers. The College of the Dark Arts teaches wizards anything they want to learn, and it focuses on teaching wizards to be as powerful as possible, so they can eventually overthrow the Royal Academy and rule Xanthia.
