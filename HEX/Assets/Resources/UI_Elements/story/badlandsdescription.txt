The Formorian Badlands are nearly a desert, where water is scarce, food is scarce, and dangerous predators are common. The Ivory Tower is the tallest structure there, with most of the buildings being fairly low to the ground and made out of mud and clay.

The Ivory Tower of Magic teaches and conducts research purely for the sake of gaining more knowledge.
