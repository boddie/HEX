Solaris is the jewel of the Chalcis Empire. However, the war with the Necromancers has left parts of it in ruins. Originally the home of the royal family and most of the noble houses of the Chalcis Empire, once the Wizard Wars started, most of the wealthy citizens fled the city for safer parts of the Empire. While the city is still beautiful, many buildings have been destroyed, and the Engineers have been too busy waging a war to make much effort to repair them. The Royal Academy of Magic gives wizards a classical training in magic and diplomacy, furthering their effort to be a force for good in the world.
