The Steampunks of Clockwork University are Xanthia’s first sentient automatons. They were originally created by the Engineers to destroy their enemies, the Necromancers. However, soon after bringing a truce to the conflict, the Steampunks started to become sentient. While most of the Engineers debated about what to do, an unhinged Engineer decided to destroy the Steampunks, as he thought they were overly dangerous. The Steampunks unilaterally destroyed him, and the Engineers were outraged. This quickly escalated into a full-blown conflict, which ended with the Steampunks escaping to the Formorian Badlands. However, the Badlanders, would not grant the Steampunks refuge, as he did not want to bring politics into the quiet life of the Badlands. The Steampunks thus fled to Pheses, an industrial city in the Chalcis Empire. They wanted the secret to constructing more Steampunks from the Engineers or the Badlanders, and a permanent home, and so, after inventing the Citadel, started a war that would soon embroil all of Xanthia. 
The Steampunks make all their decisions collectively, and they mostly just want to discover their place in the world.
