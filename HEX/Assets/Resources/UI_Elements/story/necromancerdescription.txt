The Necromancers of the College of Dark Arts consist of those from the Royal Academy who wished to rule more directly. The Necromancers believe the Chalcis royal family is a collection of spoiled individuals who have no claim to the excessive political power they wield other than their bloodline. They are led by Knaltref, a powerful sorcerer who had always secretly studied the dark arts. When the Necromancers attempted to perform a ritual to increase their power, they were destroyed, but Knaltref used their collective power, his knowledge of the dark arts, and some of his own life force to bring them back, leading to their desiccated appearance. They call themselves the Necromancers because of how they all raised each other from the dead, and because they now study the Dark Arts. After annihilating the royal family, they are at war with the Engineers, who wanted to protect them. With the Engineers at war with the Steampunks, the Necromancers see a perfect opportunity to take Solaris. 
The Necromancers want to improve the world, but they think directly controlling it is the best way to go about that and are willing to fight anyone who gets in their way.
